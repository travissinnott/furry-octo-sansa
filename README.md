An adventure in using three.js to build a prototype of my blinkie costume.  Named by github's random repo name generator.

The custome uses a IOIO Mint from Adafruit and my old Nexus One to control 10 strands of RGB LED lights sewn into a full-body zentai suit.  250 total pixels.

This is an open-source costume project.  Fork now and start hacking.  Let me know if you do anything cool with it. Contributions welcome.
